🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Project 🚢



🎨 Project Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction Project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, class, and other personal details. This project demonstrates the power of data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, often sourced from Kaggle. It contains information about Titanic passengers, including demographic and socio-economic attributes that are useful for predicting survival. Key features in the dataset include:
👤 PassengerId
🪪 Name
🧍 Sex
🎂 Age
🎟️ Ticket
🛏️ Cabin
🚪 Embarked (Port of Embarkation: C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
🤑 Fare (Ticket price)
👨‍👩‍👦 Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
👫 SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
💺 Pclass (Passenger class: 1st, 2nd, 3rd)
⚓ Survived (Target variable: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)

🌐 Project Objectives

🔄 Data Exploration & Visualization: Understand the relationships between features and survival outcomes.
🔧 Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features where necessary.
🔺 Feature Engineering: Identify key features influencing survival and create new features if required.
💡 Model Development: Build and evaluate machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
📊 Model Evaluation: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics.


🔁 Project Workflow

📖 Data Collection: Import the Titanic dataset.
📁 Data Cleaning: Handle missing data for features like Age, Embarked, and Cabin.
💡 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize distributions, check correlations, and understand feature importance.
🎨 Feature Engineering: Create new features like FamilySize (SibSp + Parch) or extract titles from passenger names.
🤖 Model Selection & Training: Train multiple models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees.
🔍 Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model hyperparameters using cross-validation and grid search.
📊 Prediction & Insights: Use the trained model to predict survival for test data.


🧰 Technologies Used

💻 Programming Language: Python
📊 Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
💡 Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression
📊 Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
🌐 Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or local IDEs

🔄 Usage

📊 Data Exploration: Run the EDA section to understand key features influencing survival.
👨‍💻 Train the Model: Train the machine learning models for prediction.
🚢 Predict Survival: Use the trained model to predict whether new passengers would survive the Titanic disaster.
📊 Results & Insights

The best-performing model was logistic regression, achieving an accuracy of X% (customize as needed).

Key influential features for survival include Pclass, Age, and Sex.

🌀 Visualization: Heatmaps, bar plots, and scatter plots were used to visualize feature relationships.

💡 Possible Improvements
🌈 Feature Engineering: Extract titles from names (Mr., Mrs., Miss, etc.) and use them as a new feature.
📚 Data Augmentation: Handle missing Age and Cabin data more effectively.
📚 Hyperparameter Tuning: Use Random Search or Bayesian Optimization to optimize model performance.
